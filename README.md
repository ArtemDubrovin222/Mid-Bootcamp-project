Mid-Bootcamp-project from IH. (29.04.2024-03.05.2024)
A project related to accidents in Berlin from 2019-2021.
All data is being taken from an official Berlin page: https://daten.berlin.de/
In this project I took 3 data sets for 3 years and combined them all of them into one, cleaned the dataset and will try to show the overview about it using different tools.
